This involves setting filters, pulling domains, and exporting the data into an Excel sheet, which is then saved as a CSV file. This CSV file is used for a list match, which can be done at a contact level or a company level. The preferred method is by domain as it's more efficient. The CSV file is uploaded, and the domains are mapped to the header in the CSV file. Once the process is complete, a notification is sent either via email or directly in the system, indicating the number of companies that have been mapped.",
